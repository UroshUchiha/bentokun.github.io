Eh, summer kinda ends for me. I have one month to sleep and do works. Works like a full-time job, going outside for some winds in afternoon.
It's not like I complain that I should deserve more money, but yeah, I spend to much unneccesary time with computer, working with EKA2L1.

Maybe It's time I change my lifestyle, going out and doing much more things. But I'm not really rich, nearly poor as I say. I wouldn't want
to waste money to buy expensive drinks or clothes just to hang out right now. The point is, I don't try to make friends. If I get along, than,
I be friends, otherwise I wouldn't try hard, it just get much annoying. Until I make more money, I can spend money in a wisely way.

In July, I will have to study 3 times / week with Informatics. You know, that I programmed well, but I kind hide it from everyone. Only some of my
friends now this page and things that I do other than learning. Also, i hate programming algorithm as much as I hate playing Fortnite. There's no point
of brainstorming things that does or help nothing to me in the future or atm.

In my friend eyes, I'm truly a nerd xD. I don't play games or either join any social org. But I play a lot of Steam games, doing emulation everyday, just 
kinda hide it from everyone. And i'm kinda feel not right to join social org without a transport device or money. Join an org means you need to hangout a 
lot to discuss plans or things for upcoming projects. I don't have money, don't have nice clothes, it just feel lost when you sitting between a bunch of morden
pretty-rich kids. I have no common to them, I'm more towards the American style.

Fortunately, on the Internet, I found people that have the same common to me. I usually traverse on Twitter or Discord, while Im not online on Facebook much (most 
Vietnamese use it). And I'm kinda happy now. Talking to them keep cheering me up. And also Todd Howard senpai.

Learning is intensitive now. Stepping into college in Vietname requires you to do a test, which consumes both grade 11 and grade 12 knowledge. I'm only grade 11 
now so from summer on, there's not much work on EKA2L1, but I promises you, when there is free time, I will both work on this and caring about my health. About
my health, It's getting bad this month. I almost dont sleep (4 hours per day), because I really want to make things work, to have Patreon money to support my 
family. My health is my priority now, so........... love <3

I'm really depressed of the money issue as you see. This fucking bear give me heartwarming answer, I should listen to him.

I will keep writing blogs. I can express myself on this, even if no one is reading. Thanks for reading.
